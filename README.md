# SimpleC-Tui-Calc
I made a calculator in C and I am on my way to becoming a "Hopefully" successful C developer as a first time programmer.
I will attempt to make a GUI calculator next so stay tuned for that and if all goes well it will be uploaded to this repo but for now you can compile the calc code above.
